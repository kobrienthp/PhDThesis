\section{Lattice (8,3)a}
\label{appendix:ThreeDimensionalKitaevModels_8_3a}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%
Lattice (8,3)a possesses three loop operators of length 8 and three of length 14 per unit cell.
These six loop operators may be combined to form three closed volumes leading to only \textit{three} independent loop operators per unit cell.
One of these closed volumes is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:appendix_8_3aVolume}.
The remaining two volumes are related by a threefold screw rotation.
The smallest vison loop in this lattice threads two plaquettes of length 8 as well as several plaquettes of length 14, as visualized in Figure~\ref{fig:appendix_8_3aVison}.

Lattice (10,3)c possesses three loop operators of length 10 and three of length 12 per unit cell.
These six loop operators can be combined to form three closed volumes, leading to only \textit{three} independent loop operators per unit cell.
One of these closed volumes is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:appendix_10_3cVolume}.

As mentioned in Section~\ref{section:chapter05_10_3c}, in order to accommodate a gauge \textit{Ansatz} compatible with the ground state flux sector, the unit cell must be enlarged in the 010-direction to a 12 site unit cell.
The sites have been relabeled for the enlarged unit cell, which is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:appendix_10_3cEnlargedUnitCell}.
